# ðŸ“˜ My CISSP Study Journey

## 1. Why I'm Starting This
I am currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity at WGU (Western Governors University)**.  
One of the most significant milestones in this program, and for my career, is obtaining the **CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)** certification.

While researching study strategies and resources, I came across an **amazing repository created by [@blazinbhayor](https://github.com/blazinbhayor)**. The approach was inspiring, and I immediately decided to create my own version of it to document my journey and help others along the way.

## 2. Purpose of This Repository
- To **document my CISSP preparation process** step-by-step, including study plans, resources, and progress updates.  
- To **share my journey openly** so anyone viewing this repository can ask questions or find guidance from my notes.  
- I hope this repository will serve as **a guide and inspiration for others** preparing for CISSP or starting a career in cybersecurity.  
- The cybersecurity field is relatively small â€” so if you are looking for someone passionate and skilled in this domain, Iâ€™m always open to discussing **career opportunities**.
